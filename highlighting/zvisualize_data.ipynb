Mathew of St. Joseph.The old Church underwent a major uplift and reconstruction in 1927 when its old front doom collapsed in 1919.In 1886 when the Archdiocese of Varapuzha was established and this Church became the Cathedral Church of the Archdiocese. This status remained with this Church till 1936 when St. Francis Cathedral was built in ErnakulamThis Church is the final resting place of 28 Carmelite Missionaries including 8 Bishops of this Diocese of VarapuzhaWhen Tipu Sultan (1750-1799) the notorious Muslim Conqueror attacked, plundered and killed many, Varapuzha was providentially left out being an island, but it became the place of refuge for all from all religions and castes. The Carmelite missionaries took care of all of them.In 1682 the Carmelite Missionaries of Varapuzha requested the Propaganda Fidei for the construction of a Seminary for the formation of the Indigenous Clergy.In 1685 the Seminary was closed down. A new Seminary was built in 1766 in Varapuzha. At that time it accepted candidates from both Latin and Syrian rites.In 1790 this seminary was closed following the attack of Tipu Sultan, the Muslim conqueror. The Seminary was reopened in 1832. In 1866 the Syrians were shifted to the Puthenpally Seminary.\n",
      "On December 18, 2017, during the inaugural southbound run of the Cascades on the Point Defiance Bypass, the train derailed while crossing Interstate 5 near the Nisqually River. Of the 84 people aboard (77 passengers and 7 employees) on board, 3 were killed.After the accident, which closed the bypass to Amtrak service, WSDOT announced that it would not resume service until the full implementation of positive train control (PTC). (Sounder service to Lakewood continued to operate.) Service was then scheduled to restart in early 2019. The PTC system was fully installed by late 2018 and activated on the Point Defiance Bypass in March 2019. The National Transportation Safety Board presented its final report on the accident on May 21, 2019, with WSDOT issuing a subsequent statement that they would need time to analyze the report before resuming service on the line. The restoration of Amtrak service on the Point Defiance Bypass was then tentatively scheduled for 2020, after agreements with local officials and the arrival of new Talgo trainsets.Passenger service on the bypass resumed on November 18, 2021, following delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.See alsoReferencesRail infrastructure in Washington (state)\n",

      "Historically this area has produced more oil than any other area in the United States, and until the discovery of oil in the Middle East, was the largest known oil reserve in the world. The Texas Railroad Commission estimates that the Texas reserves alone were  of oil including the little more than 60 billion (10 km³) already produced.Laws in the early days gave the oil flowing from the well-head to the owners of the well, prompting nearby property owners and lease holders to drill as many wells as possible to ensure they received the profits for the oil under their land. This led to rapid depletion of the resources and the immediate fall of oil prices. Also, the resulting influx of thousands of oil field workers led to wild growth of nearby boom towns and the lawlessness that accompanied them.  The states eventually succeeded in regulating the industry and passing laws for the equitable distribution of oil royalties.Oil operators, in addition to continued exploration, use a variety of techniques to increase production, including deep wells, injection wells, etc. Natural gas, which in the early days was vented to the atmosphere or burned off, now accounts for a large percentage of the exploration efforts and profitability of the petroleum industry in the Mid-continent.Proven oil reserves\n",

However, the Lions won the inaugural third place Playoff Bowl over the Cleveland Browns at the Orange Bowl in Miami.Due to (a) this being the NFL's last 12-game regular season and (b) the Dallas Cowboys giving the league 13 teams, necessitating each team have a bye during the season,the 1960 Lions are the last NFL team which did not play its season opener until October.

      "In Brazil, the Coco appears as a humanoid female alligator called Cuca. She is dressed like a woman with ugly hair and a sack on her back. Cuca appears as the one of the main villains in children's books by Monteiro Lobato, but in the books she appears like a powerful witch that attacks innocent children. Artists illustrating these books depicted the Cuca as an anthropomorphic alligator. She is an allusion to Coca, a dragon from the folklore of Portugal and Galicia.HeadsTraditionally in Portugal, however, the coco is represented by an iron pan with holes, to represent a face, with a light inside; or by a vegetable lantern carved from a pumpkin with two eyes and a mouth, which is left in dark places with a light inside to scare people. In the Beiras, heads carved on pumpkins, called coca, would be carried by the village boys, stuck on top of wooden stakes.The same name [Coca] is given to the pumpkin perforated with the shape of a face, with a candle burning in the inside—this gives the idea of a skull on fire—that the boys on many lands of our Beira carry stuck on a stick.An analogous custom was first mentioned by Diodorus Siculus (XIII.56.5;57.3), in which Iberian warriors, after the battle of Selinunte, in 469 BC, would hang the heads of the enemies on their spears. According to Rafael López Loureiro, this carving representation would be a milenar tradition from the Celtiberian region that spread all over the Iberian Peninsula.\n",

      "Ilarion Šišević ( 1219) was the Serbian Orthodox bishop of Zeta and Hum in the first half of the 13th century. He was a disciple of Archbishop Sava, and was a hieromonk of Hilandar during Sava's trip to the Patriarch Manuel I of Constantinople in Nicaea (1219). After the autocephaly of the Serbian Church (15 August 1219), hegumen Metodije of Hilandar was appointed the bishop of Raška and Ilarion was appointed the bishop of Zeta; Raška and Zeta were the central regions of the Medieval Serbian state. Ilarion was thus the first bishop of Zeta. He was also the bishop of Hum, seated at the Monastery of the Holy Mother of God in Ston (now Croatia). In literature, he is also known as Ilarije or Ilarion Šišević (Иларион Шишeвић), based on local tradition, which claims that he was born in the Šišović village in the tribal region of Građani. In the historical-anthropological work Riječka nahija u Crnoj Gori (1911) by Andrija Jovićević, local folklore has been collected, including notes on Ilarion and his family.ReferencesSources\n",

      "Unlike the look-through approach, PRIMA does not look through the various tiers of intermediaries to the underlying securities. Rather, it stops at the level of the intermediary immediately above the parties to the pledge or transfer. Its important advantage is that it subjects an investor's interest in securities to the law of a single jurisdiction, even where evidence of underlying securities is situated in many different countries, or where various issuers in a single portfolio is involved. This provides certainty and clarity for all parties involved.It is a matter of debate whether PRIMA constitutes a development of the traditional lex rei sitae principle or should be regarded as a new concept.PRIMA was adopted in a number of  jurisdictions as the conflict of laws rule to be applied to the proprietary aspects of collateral transactions. It has given way, with the Hague Securities Convention, to the approach described below.Type I PRIMA\n",
      "The so-called Type I PRIMA dates back to the late 1960s, in Belgium. Under Belgian law, the interest in respect of the underlying securities held by an investor and recorded on the books of its intermediary is treated as a different asset from the underlying securities. Thus the Belgian approach is an application of PRIMA, as well as being linked to the lex rei sitae tradition.Such an approach causes problems in some legal systems, notable of which are those of Japan and Germany. Under both their systems, an investor would be treated as the direct owner of the underlying securities even though the security is held through tiers of intermediaries. The direct ownership in the underlying securities makes it difficult to argue that the location of the asset is at the level of an intermediary.\n",

      "Managing the Jefferson household became increasingly difficult for Martha Jefferson, who had endured at least one case of smallpox, may have had diabetes, and was weakened by her numerous pregnancies, which would ultimately kill her. She bore the stress of having to flee a British invasion of Richmond in early January 1781 and a raid on Monticello in June of that year, during which she had to travel with infant children, many of whom died. She was aware that the British were interested in capturing her or her husband.Thomas limited his political service due to her health. Jefferson, in Philadelphia for the Second Continental Congress of 1776, which drafted the Declaration of Independence, wished to return to her as soon as possible. Thomas served as governor and in the House of Delegates in Virginia. He declined the offer to serve as the commissioner to France made by the Continental Congress while she was alive.The birth of their youngest child in May 1782 was reportedly the most difficult pregnancy for Mrs. Jefferson, having carried a very large baby. Edmond Randolph wrote in the month of her death that Thomas was \"inconsolable\" about Martha's declining health and pain.\" Mrs. Jefferson's health worsened and she died on September 6, 1782, four months after the birth of her last child. Jefferson was inconsolable. She was buried at Monticello and her tombstone included the words from Thomas's perspective: \"Torn from him by death\" and \"This monument of his love is inscribed\".\n",

      "100268 Rosenthal, provisional designation, is a background asteroid from the inner region of the asteroid belt, approximately  in diameter. It was discovered on 5 October 1994, by German astronomer Freimut Börngen at the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in Tautenburg, eastern Germany. The asteroid was later named for German radio and TV host Hans Rosenthal.Orbit and classification Rosenthal is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.0–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,392 days; semi-major axis of 2.44 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery published by the Digitized Sky Survey. It was taken at the Siding Spring Observatory in September 1990, more than 4 years prior to its official discovery observation at Tautenburg.Physical characteristicsDiameter estimate Based on its absolute magnitude of 15.6, its diameter is between 2 and 5 kilometers, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25.Since asteroids in the inner main-belt are often of a brighter silicaceous – rather than of a darker carbonaceous composition, with higher albedos, typically around 0.20, the asteroid's diameter might be on the lower end of NASA's published conversion table, as the lower the reflectivity (albedo), the larger the body's diameter for a given absolute magnitude.\n",

      "Sometimes it is the purpose of the conductor to maintain a fairly long silence after the last notes of a piece; this is an especially likely choice for pieces with quiet endings. The audience can be signaled not to applaud immediately through the device of the conductor keeping her hands lifted (as if still leading the orchestra), then lowering them when the intended silence is over. Thus in a way the conductor is \"conducting the audience\" as part of a performance ritual. Such efforts are usually heeded, at least by experienced audiences.Sacred works offered as worship are not applauded. Such works include settings of requiem, Passion, mass, or Kaddish prayer. Presented in an artistic context, such works, along with secular works of comparable gravity, still often get respectful silence for a long moment before any applause.In opera a particularly impressive aria will often be applauded, even if the music is continuing. Shouting is generally acceptable only during applause. The word shouted is often the Italian word bravo or a variation (brava in the case of a female performer, bravi for a plural number of performers, bravissimo for a truly exceptional performance). The word's original meaning is  \"skillful\" and it has come to mean \"well done\". The French word encore (\"again\") may be shouted as a request for more, although in Italy and France itself bis (\"twice\") is the more usual expression. In some cultures (e.g., Britain) enthusiastic approval can also be expressed by whistling, though in others (e.g., Italy, Russia) whistling can signify disapproval and act as the equivalent of booing.\n",
