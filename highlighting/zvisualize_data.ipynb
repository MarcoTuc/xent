      "Mary Gordon was born in Far Rockaway, New York, to Anna (Gagliano) Gordon, an Irish-Italian Catholic mother, and David Gordon, a Jewish father. Her father died in 1957 when she was young. She had identified with him and his love for writing and culture, and continued to learn his myths. When she was in her 40s, she began to learn about him, discovering that he had converted to Catholicism as a young man in 1937, before his marriage to her mother. His first name was Israel and he immigrated at the age of six with his family to Lorain, Ohio from Vilna, Lithuania. After his conversion, her father published some anti-Semitic and right-wing journalism. Gordon's search and attempt to reconcile her discoveries with the memory of her father became the basis of her memoir, The Shadow Man: A Daughter's Search for Her Father (1996).After being widowed, her mother Anna and Mary moved to live with her maternal grandmother, who was Irish Catholic, in Valley Stream, near Queens. Her mother worked as a secretary to support them. Gordon had a very Catholic childhood. She attended Holy Name of Mary School in Valley Stream and The Mary Louis Academy for high school in Jamaica, New York.Although her mother and her family wanted Gordon to go to a Catholic college, Gordon was awarded a scholarship to Barnard College, and she received her A.B. in 1971. She pursued graduate work, completing an M.A. at Syracuse University in 1973.\n",

He joined the Munich Museum Society, founded in 1905, and was elected its treasurer. As a member of the acquisition committee of the Alte Pinakothek and the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, he helped shape the development of their collections. He raised funds for the acquisitions of these museums and himself established a foundation for the benefit of the Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen.Berolzheimer collected prints and eventually owned about 600 pieces of graphic art as well as about 800 hand drawings by Dutch, Italian Baroque painters and from the German Romantic period, including an oil sketch of the Poor Poet by Carl Spitzweg.\n",

      "The colonial government allocated the Mount Muria area in the Northern part of Java, to the Mennonite missionary organization. Jansz refused to ask legal permission to work as a missionary because he wanted to obey a higher authority than the colonial government. Jansz unwillingly was a subject under the Article 123 of the government regulations to the Dutch Indies, which gave the authorities certain control over the missionaries. Jansz faced much turmoil over Article 123, and in 1860 the Governor General withdrew his admission as a missionary, permitting him to stay in the country only if he remained as a teacher. The DMMS made changes within their organization; and without formal discussion the Mennonite missionaries decided to follow the lead of other mission boards in making use of the financial and legal facilities offered by the colonial government to lease large parcels of land and to build and maintain schools and hospitals.\n",

      "Ngarra started painting in 1994. His work was facilitated and documented by the anthropologist Kevin Shaw.Ngarra's late paintings are defined by his use of vibrant colour contrast, which he achieved by mixing Ara acrylic paints to create his own palette. Ngarra’s paintings contain many references to pre-colonial Aboriginal traditions. His works were exhibited at the Western Australian Museum in 2000, and some are held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of Western Australia and Museum Victoria.In 2015, sixteen of Ngarra's works were included in the exhibition No Boundaries: Aboriginal Australian Contemporary Abstract Painting. Organised by William Fox and Henry Skerritt for the Nevada Museum of Art, the exhibition toured to five museums across the United States.

      "The four ships of the Regina Elena class served in the active duty squadron after their commissioning through 1911 and participated in the peacetime routine of fleet training. On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, starting the Italo-Turkish War. The four ships saw action during the war in the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron. They participated in the operations off North Africa in the first months of the war, including escorting the crossing of the Italian expeditionary army sent to conquer Cyrenaica. Later in the war, they took part in the seizure of Rhodes and the Dodecanese.Italy initially remained neutral during World War I, but by 1915, had been convinced by the Triple Entente to enter the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Both the Italians and Austro-Hungarians adopted a cautious fleet policy in the confined waters of the Adriatic Sea, and so the four Regina Elena-class battleships did not see action. They spent the war rotating between the naval bases at Taranto, Brindisi, and Valona. After the end of the war, the ships of the class were included amongst the battleships that Italy could keep in service (by the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty), but they were retained only for a few years. Between February 1923 and September 1926, all four ships were stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap.NotesReferencesFurther readingExternal links Regina Elena Marina Militare website \n",

      "Lạng Sơn has two international border crossings. The most accessed is the Friendship Gate called the Hữu Nghị Quan crossing at Đồng Đăng connecting to Pingxiang town in China. This is the historical first land link in the north between China and Vietnam that connects Lạng Sơn and Guangxi, China. The border is open daily, from 07:00 to 17:00, and involves a walk of 500 m through the no man's territory between Vietnam and China. There is an international train service, an express route, opened in 1996 from Hanoi to Beijing (China), which operates twice a week on Tuesday and Friday that passes through Lạng Sơn Town and Đồng Đăng through this gate which has three-hour stop at the border town to complete formalities of entry from one country to the other. Passengers are not allowed to board the train at any intermediate station between Hanoi and Beijing.Lạng Sơn is  to the northwest of Hanoi and National Highways 1 and 1 A and passes the Chi Lăng pass (the site of  Lê Lợi's victory over 100,000 Ming invaders from China in 1427) and Bắc Giang on National Highway 1A. Lạng Sơn is 135 km from Cao Bằng on the National Highway no 4.\n",

      "The private art college was established in 1832 by Egor Makovsky and A.S. Yastrebilov as Classes of Nature, and renamed Art Classes in 1833. In 1843, the classes were incorporated as the School of Painting and Sculpture of the Moscow Art Society.In 1865, the Palace School was incorporated into School of Painting and Sculpture; next year, the expanded institution was renamed Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. The School was unique in Imperial Russia, being a private college in a country were education was primarily state-managed. Its diplomas (excluding the few highest-ranking graduates) were ranked inferior to those of the Academy of Arts; probably unimportant in fine arts, this division was a serious burden for graduates in architecture. The School tried to close the gap through acquiring a state charter in 1896, but failed.After the October Revolution of 1917, the school was transformed in 1918 into the Second Free State Art Workshop (Svomas). Art workshops eventually disintegrated. In 1939, Igor Grabar launched the new college of fine arts, which acquired the name of Surikov Institute in 1948. Architectural education initially concentrated around VKhUTEMAS and MVTU and was organized into the Moscow Architectural Institute in 1933.Arts\n",

Langlès's close links with the Collège de France were enhanced by Baron de Sacy's support, which also resulted in Chézy becoming the Collège's first Professor of Sanskrit, Rémusat becoming its first Professor of Chinese, and Champollion becoming its first Professor of Egyptology.

      "It was described as a new species Puffinus newelli in 1900 by the American ornithologist Henry Wetherbee Henshaw using specimens obtained by Brother Matthias Newell from residents of Maui. It was later included by some authors in the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) as was Townsend's shearwater (Puffinus auricularis). Later, Townsends's shearwater was raised back to species status with Newell's shearwater as a subspecies of it. This taxonomy was followed by the American Ornithologists' Union from the sixth edition of its checklist onwards.However Newell's differs from Townsend's shearwater in various measurements and has a different breeding season and marine habitat. It is now often treated as a separate species, e.g. by BirdLife International following Brooke (2004). In 2004, a study of mitochondrial DNA sequences suggested a close relationship between Rapa shearwater (Puffinus myrtae) and Newell's shearwater and the authors proposed that Rapa shearwater be treated as a subspecies of P. newelli pending further study. The Rapa shearwater is now treated as a full species.\n",

C. turdinus hypostictus is found in the southern and western Amazon Rainforest in south-eastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northern Bolivia and Amazonian Brazil south of the Amazon River. The paler, greyer and much more uniform C. t. unicolor is found in the drier and more open wooded habitats in the Pantanal of Brazil, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay and far northern Argentina (where range is expanding). The nominate subspecies, C. t. turdinus, resembles C. t. hypostictus both in habitat preference and morphology, and is found in the narrow coastal belt of Atlantic moist forests in eastern Brazil from near Salvador da Bahia in north to Espírito Santo in south.

      "Under the 1857 Constitution of Mexico, the vice-president, the attorney general, the foreign secretary, and the interior secretary stood in line to the presidency. As well as Madero, Huerta had ousted Vice-President José María Pino Suárez and Attorney General Adolfo Valles Baca. To give the coup d'état some appearance of legality, he had Lascuráin, as foreign secretary, assume the presidency, who would then appoint him as his interior secretary, making Huerta next in line to the presidency, and then resign.The presidency thus passed to Huerta. As a consequence, Lascuráin was president for less than an hour; sources quote figures ranging from 15 to 56 minutes. To date, Lascuráin's presidency is the shortest in history, even briefer than that of Venezuelan politician Diosdado Cabello in 2002.Huerta called a late-night special session of Congress, and under the guns of his troops, the legislators endorsed his assumption of power. A few days later, Huerta had Madero and Pino Suárez killed. The coup and the events surrounding it became known as La decena trágica (\"the tragic ten [days]\").\n",

      "Phaanthosaurus is an extinct genus of basal procolophonid parareptile from early Triassic (Induan stage) deposits of Nizhnii Novgorod, Russian Federation. It is known from the holotype PIN 1025/1, a mandible (a dentary). It was collected from Vetluga River, Spasskoe village and referred to the Vokhmian terrestrial horizon of the Vokhma Formation. It was first named by P. K. Chudinov and B. P. Vjushkov in 1956 and the type species is Phaanthosaurus ignatjevi.In 2000, Spencer and Benton found Contritosaurus to be junior synonym of Phaanthosaurus. C. simus Ivakhnenko, 1974 which is known from the holotype PIN 3355/1, a partial skull with right mandible from the same location, and from three paratypes, was recombined as P. simus. They also found that the second species of Contritosaurus, C. convector (PIN 3357/1, a mandible) is a junior synonym of P. simus. Recent cladistic analyses by Juan Carlos Cisneros, 2008 and Mark J.

      "Irving Kristol posits that one reason that those who are \"experiencing a Christian impulse, an impulse toward the imitatio Christi, would lean toward socialism... is the attitude of Christianity toward the poor. \"Arnold Toynbee characterized Communist ideology as a \"Christian heresy\" in the sense that it focused on a few elements of the faith to the exclusion of the others. Donald Treadgold interprets Toynbee's characterization as applying to Christian attitudes as opposed to Christian doctrines. In his book, \"Moral Philosophy\", Jacques Maritain echoed Toynbee's perspective, characterizing the teachings of Karl Marx as a \"Christian heresy\". After reading Maritain, Martin Luther King, Jr. commented that Marxism had arisen in response to \"a Christian world unfaithful to its own principles.\" Although King criticized the Soviet Marxist–Leninist Communist regime sharply, he nonetheless commented that Marx's devotion to a classless society made him almost Christian. Tragically, said King, Communist regimes created \"new classes and a new lexicon of injustice.\"Christian socialismChristian socialism generally refers to those on the Christian left whose politics are both Christian and socialist and who see these two philosophies as being interrelated. This category can include Liberation theology and the doctrine of the social gospel.The Rerum novarum encyclical of Leo XIII (1891) was the starting point of a Catholic doctrine on social questions that has been expanded and updated over the course of the 20th century.

      "A third of hospitals in England increased their care parking charges in 2019.  The total raised from parking fees was £254 million.  A survey of 7,800 people found 86% said parking added to the stress of their hospital visit and they described the fees as a \"rip-off\", \"extortionate\" and \"astronomical\".  Car parking fees were an issue in the 2019 United Kingdom general election.  After the election Matt Hancock announced that all the 206 NHS hospital trusts in England would be expected to provide free car parking from April 2020 to people that may be frequent hospital visitors, or those disproportionately impacted by daily or hourly charges for parking, including blue badge holders, frequent outpatient attenders,  parents staying overnight with sick children in hospital, and NHS staff working nightshifts.  This timetable was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in England but NHS England ordered NHS trusts to permanently offer free car parking to night shift staff and some patient groups from April 2021.Scotland\n",
      "Claims by the Scottish National Party in 2019 that parking fees have been removed from all NHS hospitals in Scotland have been contested because there are still fees at Ninewells Hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, set up as part of the private finance initiative deals. However, in 2021, the Scottish Government announced that the charges would be abolished after reaching a £35 million deal to buy car parks at those hospitals.Wales\n",

      "Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on 11 March 1967, a year after President Michel Micombero overthrew the previous monarchy. Micombero, a Tutsi African socialist aligned with China, initially maintained a close relationship with North Korea. It was eventually strained in 1971 by alleged undermining against his military rule carried out by North Koreans among the youth members of the Union for National Progress (UPRONA). For several months he refused to accept the credentials of the North Korean ambassador, and threatened to expel all North Korean citizens.Despite this issue, North Korea aided Micombero's Tutsi regime during the Hutu uprising that broke out in 1972 the resulting genocidal violence and the deaths of 150,000 Hutus. Together with China and France, North Korea provided military support during the unrest. In the years after this, the relationship improved. In 1976, Micombero promised full support to the policies of Kim Il-sung. He was overthrown the same year.In the late 1970s, North Korean engineers constructed a presidential palace for Micombero's successor, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza.A later President, Pierre Buyoya, likewise aligned with North Korea on, among other things, expressing support for the country's plans to achieve Korean reunification. He is reported to have had possible North Korean military assistance during the Second Congo War.In 2011, it was alleged that Burundi – by purchasing defective Chinese weapons from the North Koreans through a Ukrainian company – had broken the arms embargo placed on North Korea.See also Foreign relations of Burundi\n",

      "The Cheshire Mammoth Cheese was a gift from the town of Cheshire, Massachusetts to President Thomas Jefferson in 1802.  The  cheese was created by combining the milk from every cow in the town, and made in a makeshift cheese press to handle the cheese's size. The cheese bore the Jeffersonian motto \"Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.\"History\n",
      "The town of Cheshire was incorporated in 1793 from parts of Adams, New Ashford, Lanesborough, and Windsor.  The original settlers came from Rhode Island and created New Providence Plantation on Providence Hill, later renamed to Stafford Hill in honor of Col. Joab Stafford who originally surveyed the area in 1767 and later led local revolutionary soldiers against the British in the Battle of Bennington.Given the political landscape of the time, there was a fear that the more Republican Jefferson, considered an \"infidel of the French Revolutionary school,\" would harm the religious interests of the citizenry, and that \"the altars of New England would be demolished, and all their religious institutions would be swept away by an inrushing and irresistible flood of French infidelity.\"One pastor in Cheshire, Elder John Leland, opposed this line of thought.  A beleaguered minority in Calvinist New England, the Baptists were perhaps the strongest advocates in the early republic of the separation of church and state.  Leland had met Jefferson during his time in Virginia and the two grew to have a friendly relationship.  Leland remembered this as he served in Cheshire, and campaigned strongly for Jefferson.\n",

      "DEAF microstructure (internal structure of dictionary articles) starts with an etymological discussion consisting of fluent sentences which allows for an easy approach to the otherwise elliptically condensed ’word biography’ a typical DEAF article showcases. Besides critical investigation and identifying of the etymon which includes neighbour languages, this section gives a brief description of the individual word history and discusses controversial viewpoints. The third section renders graphical variants with correspondent references and is followed by the semantic description making up the core of each article: the phrastic or Aristotelian (genus-differentia) definition first gives a generic term the meaning of which is then narrowed by adding distinctive properties until the full meaning of the word in question is clarified. The definition is flanked by at least one piece of text evidence illustrating the given meaning, a notable specificity of the DEAF being that it provides reference dating throughout the articles and makes these indications available by the bias of standardised acronymes leading to the correspondent entry in the DEAF bibliography (DEAFBibl, DEAFBiblél).\n",

      "Mike Brewer replaced former Sale and England player Jason Robinson as the club's head coach in April 2010 after a season in which Sale narrowly avoided relegation from the Premiership. Brewer instigated a number of changes including signing more than ten new players and a releasing similar number. Announced on 31 August, one such change was the appointment of Gaskell as club captain for the 2010/11 season ahead of Sale's international players such as Charlie Hodgson and Mark Cueto. Brewer explained the decision, saying that \"I know it will be a surprise to a lot of people thanks to James' age but, as far as what I'm looking for in a captain which is someone to take the club forward on this journey which we're about to embark on. I see him as a key player in the squad over the next three to five years. The biggest trait I'm looking for in a captain is someone who is prepared to put his body on the line and someone who won't be asking others to do something he's not prepared to do himself. James might be only 20 but I think he's a lot older in terms of his experience and rugby knowledge and I think he'll be a real success for the team and I know the players are right behind him.\"\n",

      "Bacon graduated from Yale University in 1856. He became minister of the Congregational Church in Orange, New Jersey, in 1861, and became a trustee of the American Congregational Union in 1866. In 1875, he was again nominated as trustee of the board of regents of the Congregational Union, but publicly stated that he declined to serve on the board with Henry C. Bowen; Bacon's father, Rev. Leonard Woolsey Bacon, felt misrepresented enough by remarks made by Bowen that he wrote a letter to the Chicago Tribune publicly disavowing any friendship with Bowen. In the same year, George Bacon delivered the commencement address at the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women.Bacon, whom The Nation called a \"lively\" writer, was a regular contributor to Scribner’s Monthly, writing on religious as well as social topics (such as Chinese immigration to the United States). He also wrote on the Sabbath question, an important subject in late-nineteenth century America when a debate was waged between those who saw the day of rest as a legal obligation and those, including Bacon, who considered it a Christian privilege. He died at age 40, on 15 September 1876, after a \"lingering illness\". In a eulogy, Scribner’s Monthly called him a \"model literary clergyman\": \"His contributions to the body of the magazine were always marked by broad views, intense dislike of sham and cant, by high moral purpose, and by a style as simple and direct as it was elegant and attractive.\"BibliographyReferencesExternal links\n",

      "Cramer is the author of The Politics of Resentment, the fruit of almost a decade of studying political attitudes in rural Wisconsin through ethnography. She argues that \"rural consciousness\" acts as a basis for rural residents to form a social identity and as a lens through which they \"think about themselves, other people, and public affairs.\" According to Cramer, a driver of political sentiment in rural Wisconsin is the beliefs among voters that \"I’m not getting my fair share of power, stuff or respect\" and \"All the decisions are made in Madison and Milwaukee and nobody’s listening to us\". Cramer has found this \"rural resentment\" comes partly from changes to rural life and partly from massive changes in the economy. Rural people, she asserts, feel overlooked and disrespected by elites; they work hard, yet they see the \"good life\" is passing them by, which is one reason why they voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Publications\n",

The name Covenant was a direct reference to the Solemn League and Covenant signed by the Scottish Covenanters of the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1950 the organisation had offices in Glasgow.The Covenant Association played an enormous part in mobilising Scottish public opinion in favour of devolution. The Scottish Covenant \"was eventually signed by two million people\". Ultimately though the Association's disengagement from the conventional political process meant that this enthusiasm waned and had no outlet, with it being some 50 years before devolution was secured for Scotland.Perhaps the greatest coup of the Covenant Association was the removal of the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey by four of their members (Ian Hamilton, Kay Matheson, Gavin Vernon and Alan Stuart) over Christmas in 1950.  This famous act attracted huge publicity for the cause of Scottish home rule.See also \n",
